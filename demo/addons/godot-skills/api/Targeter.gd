# Targeters are responsible for locating SkillUsers that meet given criteria.
# They may update manually with every request for targets or automatically 
#     as SkillUsers are added or removed from the tree.
# All depends on the criteria sought after and what the most efficient algorithm
#     is for locating nodes based on that criteria.
#
# Examples of a Targeter may include...
# Area2DTargeter: A scene with an Area2D root is instanced and attached
#                 to the node at the given NodePath and stored as a variable.
#                 Signals for area_entered and body_entered are then relayed to
#                 target_found connections for the Targeter
