# Effects are the Node-ification of the Functor concept, i.e. a function as an object.
# Effects "apply" an effect, potentially using member variables set in advance as context.
# Effects can be attached underneath Skill nodes for compositional construction of algorithms
# in a Scene. They can also be attached underneath other Effects, in which case they are
# executed prior to that Effect.
# 
# Examples of an Effect may include...
# DamageEffect:         Subtracts an "amount" from a property on the target. The default property name is "health".
#                       Has boolean "percentage": if true, "amount" is multiplied against the property and then subtracted (100 subtracts all).
# RestoreEffect:        Adds an "amount" to a property on the target, but not more than some maximum value. The 
#                       default values for the property and max property are "health" and "max_health", respectively.
#                       Has boolean "percentage": if true, "amount" is multiplied against the max property and then added (100 restores all).
# TriggerSkillEffect:   Activates a Skill when the Effect is applied. The source of the Skill matches the Effect's.
#                       The Skill in question can be attached as a child of the Effect.
