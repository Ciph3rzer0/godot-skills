# godot-skills (Work in Progress)
A generic, compositional skill system for Godot Engine that uses scenes to design abilities and their effects.

*Please note that this project is far from finished. I am waiting to complete it's implementation until after I have revised the custom type system in Godot Engine. It will target a 3.1 release.*
